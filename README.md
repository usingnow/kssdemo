Koosushi Demo project

Suggest to remove this project as some files shall be ignore in the git for the later deployment and capistrano. Although Capistrano website gives a solution to thoroughly remove the track of files in git. But, the step is very complicated. If you wanna try these step, you'd better do it now for the sake of lower risk and cost.

As for the jbz, i have no confident to handle it that way~ Just a reminder.

Here is some samples:

database.yml
Mac OS file deletion keep files (if you delete anything in the finder.)
environment file of dev and test. (cause differet contributors might have different env and OS.)
etc...
